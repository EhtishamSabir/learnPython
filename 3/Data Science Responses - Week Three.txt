Data Science – Learning Management Questions

Week Three – Question #1   
import numpy
import scipy.stats
import pandas

def compare_averages(filename):
    """
    Performs a t-test on two sets of baseball data (left-handed and right-handed hitters).

    You will be given a csv file that has three columns.  A player's
    name, handedness (L for lefthanded or R for righthanded) and their
    career batting average (called 'avg'). You can look at the csv
    file by downloading the baseball_stats file from Downloadables below. 
    
    Write a function that will read that the csv file into a pandas data frame,
    and run Welch's t-test on the two cohorts defined by handedness.
    
    One cohort should be a data frame of right-handed batters. And the other
    cohort should be a data frame of left-handed batters.
    
    We have included the scipy.stats library to help you write
    or implement Welch's t-test:
    http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html
    
    With a significance level of 95%, if there is no difference
    between the two cohorts, return a tuple consisting of
    True, and then the tuple returned by scipy.stats.ttest.  
    
    If there is a difference, return a tuple consisting of
    False, and then the tuple returned by scipy.stats.ttest.
    
    For example, the tuple that you return may look like:
    (True, (9.93570222, 0.000023))

Week Three  – Question #2

    Compute the cost of a list of parameters, theta, given a list of features 
    (input data points) and values (output data points).

    """
    Perform gradient descent given a data set with an arbitrary number of features.
    """

    # times. Every time you compute the cost for a given list of thetas, append it 
    # to cost_history.

Week Three – Question #3   
import numpy as np

def compute_r_squared(data, predictions):
    # Write a function that, given two input numpy arrays, 'data', and 'predictions,'
    # returns the coefficient of determination, R^2, for the model that produced 
    # predictions.
    # 
    # Numpy has a couple of functions -- np.mean() and np.sum() --
    # that you might find useful, but you don't have to use them.

    return r_squared
